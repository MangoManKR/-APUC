HYU CSE ITE3062 인간컴퓨터상호작용 Project 1

# APUC
This is mobile application named Avoid Place by Unreal Call (APUC)

# Develop Tool
Android Studio, Kotlin

# Project Objectives
This application provides the service that display the ringing screen when user acts a predetermined trigger. The trigger can be press volume up button 5 seconds, press both volume up and down button 3 seconds, or tap their wearable device and so on. Then user can choose to accept or deny the call. If user accept the call, the application play the recorded voice, the voice can be familiar, and notify that he or she is nearby the user(This is not true.). By this, user can avoid the reluctant place (or people).

# Expected Effects
This application can help user to leave reluctant people or place, or to avoid threaten by unknown person(stalking). Even though there are several other methods like real call from family or friends, or other self-defense supplies. This can be useful because of convenience and simple trigger. I set 2 goals of this application, first one is avoid reluctant place, another one is avoid from emergency situation. I can do user study by surveying which of the two uses did user use this application for more? So, we can understand user’s needs and can modify (or develop) the application to fit with their desire. In my opinion, users will use this app more for policing purposes.
